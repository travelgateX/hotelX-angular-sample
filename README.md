## Deployment

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project works with an [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/es/) server through NodeJS. First you must build the `dist/` folder with `npm run build` or `npm run build-w` for watching changes. Run `npm run server` to deploy de server with port 8080. Visit `http:localhost:8080` to see de application.

Here there is a list of the most common commands:

```
"build": "ng build -pr false",
"build-w": "ng build -w -pr false",
"build-prod": "ng build --prod",
"build-prod-w": "ng build --prod -w",
"server": "node server/server.js",
"server-prod": "NODE_ENV=prod node server/server.js"
```
